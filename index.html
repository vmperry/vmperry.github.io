                <h3>5 Years, Part Time</h3>
                <p>For the past five years, I have volunteered my time and skills to three organisations in which I have a personal interest. 
                    I have managed the website for <a class="web-links" href="https://www.heronbankrescue.co.uk/" target="_blank">Heronbank Cat Rescue</a>, 
                    completely redesigning it and creating content. This has been on a voluntary basis for over five years, as the rescue is a non-profit with limited funds, 
                    and it is a cause close to my heart. I have also volunteered my time with them in other capacities.

                    <br><br>Additionally, I manage and update the website for <a class="web-links" href="https://yourskinsecretsuk.co.uk/" target="_blank">Skin Secrets</a>, a small business 
                    in Bedfordshire. I took over this role around two years ago when the business lost its domain name due to negligence from the previous hosting and 
                    management company. The owner was very distressed, fearing she had lost both the website and the domain. Although the domain had already been purchased
                     by the time I was brought in, I successfully recovered the website and have been working with the owner to keep it updated ever since.
                    
                    <br><br>For the past year, I have also managed the website for my local <a class="web-links" href="https://www.leeds-scuba-club.co.uk/" target="_blank">scuba diving club</a>, 
                    handling updates and making necessary changes. This role is voluntary, as I am a committee member. I am currently in discussions with the club regarding 
                    significant updates to the site, which we hope will increase both web traffic and membership.</p>

                <span>Primary Education and IT Curriculum Leadership</span>
                <h3>14 Years, Full Time</h3>
                <p>As a primary teacher, I have developed a wide range of transferable skills that are directly applicable to software development. 
                    My ability to break down complex concepts into simple, manageable steps has been key to teaching diverse learners and is equally valuable 
                    in coding and problem-solving. Strong communication skills, adaptability, and the capacity to think critically and systematically have been 
                    central to my teaching practice. These skills enable me to approach software development with clear, logical thinking and an ability to convey 
                    technical information effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.

                    <br><br>As a computing curriculum lead, I led the design and implementation of the computing syllabus across multiple year groups. 
                    This involved project management, collaborating with colleagues, and ensuring that the curriculum met national standards while fostering 
                    digital literacy and programming skills among students. I gained a deep understanding of programming fundamentals, problem-solving, and 
                    critical thinking, which I integrated into lessons to engage and inspire pupils. My experience in curriculum coordination has honed my 
                    organisational skills, attention to detail, and ability to manage complex tasks, all of which are essential in software development.</p>

                <span>Service Industry</span>
                <h3>7 Years, Part Time</h3>
                <p>While studying at school, college and university, I gained seven years of experience in the service industry. 
                    This included roles as a retail assistant, barmaid, and silver service waitress, I developed a range of transferable 
                    skills that are highly relevant to software development. These roles required excellent communication, the ability to work 
                    efficiently under pressure, and strong problem-solving skills to manage customer needs and resolve issues promptly. 
                    I also gained valuable experience in teamwork, adaptability, and time management, balancing multiple tasks and priorities 
                    in fast-paced environments. These skills, along with a strong work ethic and attention to detail, provide a solid foundation 
                    for my transition into software development, where clear communication, collaboration, and the ability to meet deadlines are essential.</p>
